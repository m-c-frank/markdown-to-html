# markdown-to-web

not my first attempt at making something like this

goal is to publish beautiful markdown files with minimal effort

allow pure intuitive decisions to guide rapid development

## todo

- [x] add tools directory
- [x] check if convert.js works locally
- [x] add .gitignore
- [x] create index html file
- [x] create single page html files for each note
- [ ] make convert.js use something like my legacy node viewer project
- [ ] deploy this webpage using publish

## chatgpts oopsies

i asked chatgpt to create this program and said write the end2end test first

thats all fine and it started generating the script but didnt start with a test.js file

and if you dont know much about computers then this is a very good example of the problems with llms for software development

i have first hand experience knowing where something like this could lead to problems in my research under the european space agency


## notes

notes are mostly generated by [note](https://github.com/m-c-frank/note)

and i can create notes very easily with just two steps

ask me if youre interested
