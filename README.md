# markdown-to-web

not my first attempt at making something like this

goal is to publish beautiful markdown files with minimal effort

this is the convert md to html part

have an index file and single pages aswell

allow pure intuitive decisions to guide rapid development

## todo

- [x] add tools directory
- [x] check if convert.js works locally
- [x] add .gitignore
- [x] create index html file
- [x] create single page html files for each note
- [ ] make convert.js use something like my legacy node viewer project
- [ ] deploy this webpage using publish

i asked chatgpt to create this program and said write the end2end test first

thats all fine and it started generating the script but didnt start with a test.js file

and if you dont know much about computers then this is a very good example of the problems with llms for software development

## notes

notes are mostly generated by [note](https://github.com/m-c-frank/note)

and i can create notes very easily with just two steps

ask me if youre interested
